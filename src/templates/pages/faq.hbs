                                        First, make sure that you are logged into your account. If you see a 'Login' button in the upper-right corner <a href="https://app.enhancv.com" target="_blank">here</a> that means you are logged out of the platform.

                                        If the previous time you registered via email and now you login via Facebook/LinkedIn that would result in creating two separate accounts. That also happens if you first joined, for example, via LinkedIn and are logging in with Facebook. Therefore, check if the previous time you didn't login via a different provider.

                                      In most of the cases this means that you have to open the site in fullscreen or expand the window.
                                      The message is shown whenever there isn't enough space available in the window to display the editor properly.
                                      If you have any sidebars from your OS (OSX or Mac OS for example) that are placed vertically they can reduce the available space for the window,
                                      so in these cases we recommend that you place them in a horizontal position if you still see the message appearing.
                                      Our mobile version is coming soon and these problems are only temporary.

                                      First, make sure that you've entered the card number, CCV and expiration date correctly. The name and address under billing should be the same as the cardholder because our payment processor does fraud-detection. A mismatch between billing and cardholder name is a frequent reason for a decline.

                                      <strong>Do you issue refunds?</strong>
                                      To get a refund you should contact us and we will investigate the matter and explain the process.
                                    </p>

                                      <strong>I need an invoice for my payment. Where and when can I view or download it?</strong>
                                      When our payment processor notifies us that your transaction is settled, we will send you an email with the invoice. That usually takes about 12 hours.
                                      If you want to download your invoice later you can do it from the <a href="https://app.enhancv.com/settings/billing" target="_blank">Billing page</a>.

                                      Yes :) Choose the Layout option from the sidebar and switch the 'Remove Logo' option. Have in mind that this is a Pro feature.

                                      <strong>Can I rearrange the sections and the items in them?</strong>
                                      Yes. You can drag the items within a section to reorder them. To move entire sections (e.g. Experience, Education) go to 'Rearrange/Edit' in the sidebar. The platform automatically calculates how to position entries across pages, so sometimes a single section could be spread across multiple pages.
                                    </p>

                                      Just click the section item you want to change, then on the wheel icon above it. There you'll see all the show/hide options.

                                      Yes, you can. We keep a history of the last actions you made.
                                      You can use it by clicking the Undo and Redo buttons which are located in the upper part of the sidebar. Changes made in previous browser sessions cannot be reverted unfortunately.

                                      <strong>Can I change the font size of the texts and headings in the resume?</strong>
                                      Unfortunately, we don't support that. We are working on a new condensed layout, however, that will be released soon!

                                      Not for now, but we give you a complete freedom of how you arrange your sections, which fields are visible, what colors and fonts you choose as well as what icons you put.
                                      Different resume layouts including a condensed variant (one that fits more text on one page) are coming soon.

                                      Yes you can. For the Free plan you can have 2 different resumes in your dashboard. If you need more than 2 you'll have to use one of our paid plans!

                                      <strong>Can I export my resume as a MS Word document or HTML code?</strong>
                                      No. We've picked PDF because it is the only one that guarantees your resume will always look good across devices. It is also a format that everyone accepts!

                                      <strong>Why is my resume shortened after choosing the Free plan to download it?</strong>
                                      You were probably using Pro features and in order to download without upgrading you have to hide/remove those. You most definitely clicked on 'Remove Premium Features'.

                                      Sure. Just leave the second date (the 'to' date) empty.
                                    </p>

                                      We don't have that functionality. It is a little hack, but you can use the Books section for that ;)
