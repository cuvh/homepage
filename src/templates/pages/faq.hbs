                                        <strong>I am not able to find my resume. It seems to be gone. Why has it disappeared?</strong>
                                        â€‹There can be various reasons why you can't see your resume at first after opening our platform.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The first one can be that you are probably signed out of your profile.
                                        If you see a button labeled 'Login' in the upper right corner of the screen that means you are logged out of the website.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Another reason for this could be that you have created more than one different accounts in the platform and that you are currently logged in the wrong one.
                                        Most of the times this is caused by a confusion that if you have an email account by us with a password and use the facebook or linkedin buttons for login you will be logged into that particular account, which is wrong.
                                        The first time you use the facebook or linkedin buttons and give the permissions in the next window a new account will be created for you in our platform, pre-filled with the data we can collect from these social networks.
                                        This is because most of the times the email addresses you are registered with in these social networks are different than the one you use to register an email account with password by us
                                        and simply because most of our users want to have more than one account without registering with a new email address for these profiles.
                                        When you use these social buttons for the second time you will be logged in the corresponding account in our platform.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        If none of the above cases seems to be your's than probably we are experiencing some technical problem
                                        or maybe there is something else that is wrong with your account and you should contact us so we can check what is wrong and get it fixed.

                                        you have to first log into it from the login popup window then go to this link: <a href="https://app.enhancv.com/settings" target="_blank">My Account</a>.

                                        After clicking it, you'll have to confirm the delete by writing the word DELETE in the input and clicking the 'Terminate' button and your account will be deleted permanently.

                                      You can also view the full resume examples under the section 'Get Inspired' in the same toolbox of the editor by clicking on the resume thumbnail image.

                                      If your university student email doesn't bare a domain ending in .edu then you have to write to our support
                                      and provide an university email domain that is valid for all students of this university or faculty and we will add it to our registers.

                                      Once your university's email domain is added to our records, you can start inviting your fellow students.
                                      When you reach the required registered students count, which you can view from the platform while inviting, the student plan will be unlocked for all people in this university or faculty.
                                      The sooner you reach the count the sooner the plan will be unlocked for all students.

                                      In most of the cases this means that you have to open the site in fullscreen.
                                      This is a message that gets shown when there isn't enough space available in the window to display the editor properly.

                                      <br>
                                      Your window should not be resized and it should be spanned to full width and height if possible
                                      because the resolution of your computer is not good enough to provide enough space to accommodate the resume editor properly and since we still do not offer a mobile version, for the time being, this is the only option to work with our platform.

                                      Our payments use Braintree as a gateway payment provider. Through this gateway we accept payments with most of the popular credit and debit cards
                                      (Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, American Express, Discover, JCB, Diner's Club, Carte Blanche, China UnionPay, Laser, Switch, Solo) and payments with PayPal.
                                      We also accept EMV (i.e. chip and pin) and 3D Secure cards for payments.

                                      <br>
                                      The Enhancv platform complies with latest PCI DSS rules and it is validated through Braintree's partner, Security Metrics.

                                      <br>
                                      An acceptable decline ratio for credit card payments is about 10%, but this may fluctuate so the recommended payment method by us is PayPal as it has a really good success rate.

                                      For all the users that paid for a full year on the previous payment scheme we decided to give 3 months free access.
                                      If you are one of these users, after that period, you are going to be transferred to the Free plan
                                      and if you wish to continue using our pro features you will have to make a subscription with the new payment scheme we have enrolled.

                                      <strong>Is this a one-time payment, or is it recurring?</strong>
                                      â€‹Our payments are recurring. We offer a monthly recurring subscription and an annual one which gives you 20% OFF from every monthly payment for the whole year.

                                      If you want to use our paid services for one occasion only we suggest that you make a monthly subscription and cancel it afterwards so you will only get billed for one month.

                                      so this means that not all credit and debit card payments succeed and the reasons vary - the card may not be compatible or it may have expired,
                                      there may be insufficient funds in it or your bank may have declined the transaction.
                                      In these cases we recommend that you contact the bank that issued the card to get more information or just use a PayPal account for making the payment.

                                      But we are currently working on multiple resumes per account and resume duplication with a single click.

                                      This happened because you have used paid features in your resume and you have chosen the Free plan.
                                      You must have no pro features in order to download your pdf.
                                      This is why you are offered to remove all the paid features in a popup window that opens after you click on the 'Remove Premium Features' button on the Plans page.

                                      <br>
                                      After you confirm the remove we strip all paid features for you.
                                      One of the rules for using the Free plan is that you can't have more that 15 section items for the whole resume.
                                      For example one language in the Language section and one passion entry in the Passions section are considered to be two section items.
                                      So we strip the last 15 section items added.
                                      That's why your resume info gets stripped after removing pro features.

                                      You can undo the removal action by clicking on the Undo button in the upper part of the main left toolbar,
                                      but only if you haven't made a lot of other changes afterwards because we only keep a limited history of the last changes made to the resume.

                                      <strong>How can I upload an image for each of my certificates?</strong>
                                      If you try to use the certificates section you won't be able to do this for now.
                                      But if you use the books section and rename it's heading to Certificates, then you'll have the possibility to upload images to every entry.
