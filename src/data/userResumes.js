Something that is more visually appealing, because in tech, it's always about standing out.",

			"Daniel was born and raised in the small town of Port Elizabeth, in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. He’s always had a passion for tech and remote work, which is why he started off working remotely for US web hosting companies. “Different time zones meant I could help out while they slept.” As a result, he’s never worked in an office. “But my friends have assured me that I’m not missing out on much,” he chuckled.\nApart from working in tech, Daniel loves the audio/visual industry where he helps with anything from lightning to sound engineering. Working remotely has enabled him to turn some of his passions into side projects. That’s how he managed to work with national artists in South Africa as well as local gigs around the city, or even develop a Chrome extension to help users manage bookmarks easier.\nWith all the work he was doing, at some point Daniel realized he wanted to climb higher on the career ladder. He did it in just four steps.",

			},
			{
				title: "What would you like to learn in your new role?",
				description:
					"Focusing on this step helped Daniel decide what his resume should focus on. In previous roles, he worked in customer support, and in the new role, he wanted to take it to the next level.\n“Considering that my aim was to focus more on working with developers, people who I could better relate to and possibly learn something from, I went on the hunt for a position that would still suit customer support but would have me speaking to programmers and developers who have a deeper understanding of why something might be broken and just need a hand fixing it.”",
			},
			{
				title: "Which companies can teach you what you want?",
				description:
					"Before looking for companies that would suit his requirements, Daniel thought in more detail about how his skills could match the new desired role. As he’s worked remotely most of his career, he needed a company that would allow for that. Another requirement was a company that’s known for exceptional customer support. That’s how he came across Intercom.\n“After researching Intercom, I immediately related to their mission statement of ‘Making Internet Business Personal’, specifically when it comes to customer support. Since remote working has been my life and so has customer support, I had a lot of experience with ‘faceless’ software solutions where you would speak to ‘Agent X’ or get a reply from ‘support@businessname’ which was never personal.”\nFor Daniel, this wasn’t just a dream company, but an opportunity to grow. He looked at his old customer service resume and instantly knew he needs something different to be able to stand out. This led him to the last step.",

					"“When you finish a Word Doc, you’re still quite stressed about formatting, about whether something’s going to break at some point in time, or if you’ve completely missed a section. So it never really makes you feel great about sending that Doc along.”\nThat’s when Daniel decided to search for a resume builder. The decision was easy enough. “The modular design of each section on Enhancv meant that I could also make sure I didn’t forget anything and didn’t need to worry about irrelevant stuff like making sure my formatting didn’t break the look of any section of my resume. Instead of wasting time on formatting and styling issues, I could focus on what matters most - having the perfect representation of who I am and what I can offer.”\nSo Daniel created a resume tailored for the position at Intercom. That meant showcasing his extended experience in customer support, and because he wanted to work closely with developers, demonstrating his programming knowledge in side projects. His resume fit Intercom’s recruiter Ewa’s motto: “hiring big thinkers with small egos...” He got hired.",

This is obviously easier said than done, but self reflection got Sam there and it boosted her confidence.\nStill, it wasn’t enough and Sam eventually turned to a tech career consultant. This person essentially just confirmed that Sam was doing everything right. In retrospect, it wasn’t necessary to hire them, but the validation was still useful in getting Sam into the right mindset.",

					"Sam’s networking strategy relied on the Meetup app and communities like Lesbians Who Tech. This started while she was still at her old job, but eventually she decided to quit and devote 100% of her time to the search. For each event she found interesting, she would look up the hosting company and really research it. That way, it was far easier for her to talk to them at the event.\nSam got a few interviews as a result. Her research made those interviews go well, but she still didn’t get a job. Something was missing from her strategy.",

					"Having worked as a hiring manager looking at hundreds of resumes a day, Sam knew what made an impression and what didn’t. A career change resume in particular needed to make a compelling case for why she was making the change. Hers had a lot of personality with sections about her favorite books and hobbies. This totally changed the tone of interviews, where questions about her interests leading to more natural conversations.\nHer resume had the same effect at tech conferences where she had the same genuine and natural conversations with potential employers. This made them remember her out of the hundreds of people they spoke to over the course of a day (even years later, some still remember her!) Even recruiters who didn’t normally take resumes were willing to take hers.",

					"Ultimately, a resume doesn’t mean very much unless it’s in the right hands. For Sam, this meant getting her resume to Spotify through a friend at a trivia night. Sam applied for the position this friend was leaving. Her resume also made it to Spotify through a recruiter. The result was that two different people involved in hiring at Spotify noticed her resume and one bringing it to the other and saying “You should check this out for the job.“\nJust like that, Sam got a job where she could really be herself. It took a year of planning and hard work along with a bit of luck, but it made all the difference. Today, Sam leads 600 people and reports directly to the CEO of Spotify.",

But more importantly, it shows how a new career can transform your life, bringing you more satisfaction and impact. Now that you’ve read Sam’s story, you can see the resume that made recruiters take notice and remember her even years later.",
