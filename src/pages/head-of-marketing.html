                    <p>Enhancv exists to help people unlock their full potential, the best version of themselves, as we empower them to create and action their careers. We are currently developing the most used resume building platform in the world. Our commitment results in redefining the rules of success (at work) and helping people design their life philosophy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The opportunity:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>We are now looking for a Head of Marketing to join our team in Dublin. With you joining us, we’d accomplish two of our main goals - rebranding and respectively hitting the US market with a louder and bolder statement. The long term challenge is to fix what we believe is a seriously broken industry - Talent Acquisition, by disrupting both the ancient black &amp; white resume and the dominance of professional networks.  Above all, your work will impact the way people apply for their dream jobs and whether they get them or not.</p>
                    <p>You would become part of a company that has an experimentation mentality, data-driven culture and growth habits. We’ve been featured in almost every major US tech media outreaching journalists from Sofia, Bulgaria. We grow for 5 weeks from 3k to 70k MRR with zero budget. Now we are on the hunt for the next big thing-becoming job applicants’ one-stop shop for self-marketing &amp; self-discovery.</p>
                    <p>If you want to lead the company’s communication and brand strategy achieving this and you do find yourself in the words below, let’s do it together.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What you’re going to do:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lead and grow a team of driven and humble domain experts in performance, content and digital marketing, as well external PR and creative agencies</li>
                            <li>Discover new channels that we haven’t utilized yet and dive in them rapidly</li>
                            <li>Build and own the company’s growth strategy with 3x, 10x, or why not 50x our current scale? (We’ve seen that it’s possible)</li>
                            <li>Own a 6-figure marketing budget and allocate it optimally across all our tools and channels</li>
                            <li>Steward the new Enhancv brand and voice, and ensure consistency in all communication efforts</li>
                            <li>Work alongside the COO &amp; CSO, but act as a CEO in your own division - hire, mentor and grow people.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What we’re looking for in this role:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You are equally left-brained and right-brained - you are a creative genius when it comes to experiments, but you know how to execute, measure and improve them.</li>
                            <li>Growth is your middle name - you are biased towards turbo-scaling a startup and you would remove any barrier on the way.</li>
                            <li>Record of success in leading teams, measurement of ROI, and accountability for results, ideally in another B2C startup.</li>
                            <li>You know what’s difference between #25 and #1 not only in google.com - you seek world-class results from yourself.</li>
                            <li>You learn every day - you have deep &amp; various skill set, but you know that being good in marketing is all about learning and executing.</li>
                            <li>We don't necessarily look for someone with 10+ years of experience, but we do expect deep knowledge in marketing stack and expertise in all digital marketing channels.</li>
                            <li>You like rolling up your sleeves and doing the work yourself if needed - even when it comes to finding a certain journalist’s email or rewriting the copy of our team page.</li>
                            <li>You’re not just used to remote working teams, international traveling and different cultures, but you actually thrive in such environment.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
