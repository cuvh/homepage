                <p>
                    Resumes are deeply personal documents which reveal a lot
                    about you. Enhancv values your privacy, so we've developed
                    an easy to understand Privacy Policy that covers how we
                    collect and use your information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Depending on your relationship with Enhancv, this info may
                    include usage information, log information, account or
                    billing information, payment details, contact information.
                    You can understand when we collect and how we treat each
                    type of data in the sections below.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When we refer to “we” and “us”, we mean Enhancv Ltd. which
                    controls the information collected when you use our services
                    on the Enhancv platform (also called "service", “product”
                    within this document) to create your resume (or, as better
                    known in other parts of the world, a CV) or any other
                    document.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Keep in mind we never share the information you provide with
                    third parties, except for chosen partners that are used for
                    the purpose of providing you with a stable and enjoyable
                    experience when using Enhancv. We have tried to outline here
                    the main points of how these partners and third party
                    services collect and use data, but for the most detailed and
                    up-to-date information you should review their own privacy
                    policies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You always remain in control of your data. You may edit or
                    erase your data from our services at any time or ask us to
                    update or erase information we store, as long as this
                    erasure is not in conflict with any legal obligations we may
                    hold to national and international regulators.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By providing us with your data, you warrant to us that you

                    identifiable information from our records.

                    If, during the usage of Enhancv, you decide to take
                    advantage of our Invite Friends feature and decide to invite

                    addresses of those friends in order to show you whether they
                    have subscribed through your link or not, to provide you
                    with the option of resending the invitation and to remind
                    you which of your friends you’ve already invited. In all
                    other cases when using the feature (e.g. sharing the link on
                    social media or as a link in direct messaging platforms), we
                    will only collect referral data, showing us a person came

                    Log data contain data about the nature of each access of our
                    services, including originating Internet Protocol (IP)
                    addresses and endpoint (the requested files on our
                    platform), as well as timestamps for this activity. Web
                    servers usually keep log files that record data each time a
                    device accesses those servers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will also collect error logs which may collect more
                    system data needed to fix known platform bugs.

                    Log data is used to analyze platform usage, improve
                    performance and eliminate any bugs. We primarily look at
                    this information in aggregate, but we might review
                    individual logs when looking for the cause of a specific
                    issues. This may happen either by our own initiative or in
                    relation to a request you log with our customer success
                    team.

                    bugs and user issues, and to monitor any attempts for
                    unauthorised access to our services.
