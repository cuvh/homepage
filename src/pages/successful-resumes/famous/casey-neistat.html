When he turned 30 he was producing hollywood films, attending prestigious film festivals, and even winning some awards. So he was successful, right? Yes, but he still gave it all up to do something else.</p>
                    <p>Because his “why” was freedom, self expression, and storytelling. He may have succeeded at his goal, but he knew that his “why” was not fulfilled. So, he changed his goal to making great YouTube videos.</p>

                    <p>The “why” was the challenge and creativity. Once he felt himself getting into a rhythm, the vlogs were too easy and not as interesting. So he shifted to making fewer but higher quality videos. The goal changed, but the “why” was always the same.</p>
