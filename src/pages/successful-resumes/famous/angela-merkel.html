    description="Named the most powerful woman in the world for 9 of the past 10 years, Angela Merkel's resume isn't short on accomplishments. But more than just showing what she's done, her resume shows how she balances her life and how what she's most proud of defines her. So when she mentions what she did the night the Berlin Wall fell, it's more than just a story, it's a statement about how she views the world and her work."
